GitHub created for homework submission (due July 29, 2021)

In this homework, our task was to analyze the animal experiment data that compares the efficiency of 9 oncology drugs. Three conclusions we can draw from the analysis are:

1) Among the 9 drugs tested, 4 drugs (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) showed the most promising results, judging from the box plot. Comparing the four drugs, Capomulin or Ramicane-treated mice had the smallest tumor volume at the end of the experiment. It implies that they are the most efficient drug of the nine. 

2) Capomulin decreased the tumor size in a somewhat steady manner over the 45 days of its treatment, reaching around a 48.22 % decrease in tumor volume. 

3) One limitation of this analysis is the lack of comparison of the starting tumor volume and the endpoint tumor volume. In the scope of this analysis, tumor volume at timepoint 0 was 45.0 mm3 for all mice; thus, we can conclude just by looking at the final tumor volume. But in an actual scientific study, I would look at the change of tumor volume over time because the starting tumor volume might not be the exact same in all mice. I would also draw a line graph showing the average and standard deviation of tumor volume vs. time for each drug regimen to more accurately compare tumor regression.
